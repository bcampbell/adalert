rough plan:

- As you browse, the extension will ask the server about each page.

- any returned 'sponsored content' flags (and later, other warning
labels, links, sources, comments etc) from the server will be popped up
in the browser.

- You can click on the extensions button and pick "report this page" if
you think a page is sponsored content.

- If a page has been reported, there'll be options to agree/disagree
with the report.

- Contentious pages will be marked as such (eg "25 people think this is
sponsored content, but 14 do not")

- When the extension checks pages against the server, only a hash of the
URL will be sent, so the server can never track what pages you're
looking at unless there are they've been flagged.

- There'll be a whitelist of sites which are to be checked (preloaded
with news sites, but the user can add and remove sites themselves)

- there'll probably be an option to also check pages which have obvious
article markup, even if they're not on a whitelisted site.

- when a page is reported, the full URL does need to be sent to the
server, not just a hash.

- reporting is frictionless - you don't need to log in or anything

- there'll be a simple mechanism to stop people reporting pages multiple
times (but it won't be fullproof. If abuse happens, we move to full user
accounts)

- I wasn't planning to have a human-facing web site to start with. But
thinking about it as I type: it'd be good to have a simple site to just
browse through articles which have been reported (and to make that data
available to others). Very handy for testing.
